Hello doug62, sorry to disturb you! I've been looking to a way to contact you, and this is the only way I found! I was able to find you by a post on the frigate website! Is the domain https://frigate.k8.cloud10.systems/ yours? Don't know if you are aware, but your frigate instance is open to the world, and listed on Google... I was serching the web and found the url! If it's intencional, great! If not you should fix it!
